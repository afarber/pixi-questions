This project is a web application that displays draggable playing cards with a 3D tilt effect.

It is built using modern web technologies:
-   **JavaScript (ES Modules)**
-   **Pixi.js** for rendering and user interaction.
-   **@pixi/sound** for audio.
-   **@pixi/ui** for UI components.
-   **TWEEN.js** for animations.
-   **Vite** as a build tool and development server.
-   **Vitest** for unit testing.
-   **Playwright** for end-to-end testing.
-   **ESLint** for code linting.
-   **Prettier** for code formatting.

The project also includes a localization feature to support multiple languages. The application uses PNG and SVG assets for the playing cards and OGG files for sound effects.
